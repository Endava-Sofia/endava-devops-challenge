I created totally 4 VMs as AWS EC2 RHEL 7 instances.
One of them has Jenkins as a stand alone instance, which triggers project called "Provision_LAMP".
This projects needs to be build in order to provision Apache HTTPD, MySQL and PHP separately on each of the three other remaining AWS instances.

Jenkins can be accessed via this URL:
ec2-18-218-241-135.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080
Credentials to access it are:
user: DemoAdmin
pass: DemoAdmin

Project "Provision_LAMP" does not have parameters and is directly build.
In a few words it:
- installs Apache HTTPD on a server
- installs MySQL on another server
- installs PHP on third server
- install on all three Datadog Agents.
- install cronjobs on Apache and MySQL machines.

In addition my AWS account has been associated with DataDog using respective Datadog relate policy and rule.

Running services Apache HTTPD and MySQL are started with "systemctl".
Apache HTTPD and MySQL are congigured as "enabled" systemd services, which will automatically start them after VM reboot.
APache HTTPD get additional directive in its .service file to be always restarted when process is not present.
In addition simple cronjobs were added to check HTTPD and MYSQLD as processes on the VMs.
If not running - they will be started via systemctl.
