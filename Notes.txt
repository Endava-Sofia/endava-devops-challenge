This text file explains the final implementation of the "Endava DevOps challenge" task.

In my AWS account I created totally 4 VMs as AWS EC2 RHEL 7 instances.
One of them has Jenkins as a stand alone instance, which triggers project called "Provision_LAMP".
This projects needs to be build in order to provision Apache HTTPD, MySQL and PHP separately on each of the three other remaining AWS instances.

Jenkins can be accessed via this URL:
ec2-18-218-241-135.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080

Credentials to access it are:
user: DemoAdmin
pass: DemoAdmin

Project "Provision_LAMP" does not have parameters and is directly build.
In a few words it:
- installs Apache HTTPD on a server
- installs MySQL on another server
- installs PHP on third server
- installs on all three Datadog Agents.
- installs cronjobs on Apache and MySQL machines.

In addition my AWS account has been associated with DataDog using respective Datadog related policy and rule.

Services Apache HTTPD and MySQL are started with "systemctl".
Apache HTTPD and MySQL are configured as enabled "systemd" services, which will automatically start them after VM reboot.
Apache HTTPD gets additional directive in its ".service" file in order to be always restarted when process is not present.
In addition, simple cronjobs were added to check if HTTPD and MYSQLD as processes are running on the respective VMs.
If not running - they will be started via "systemctl".
